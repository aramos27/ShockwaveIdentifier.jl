[![Build Status](https://github.com/aramos27/ShockwaveIdentifier.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/aramos27/ShockwaveIdentifier.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

## About

**ShockwaveIdentifier** is a Julia module designed for detecting and analyzing shockwaves in computational fluid dynamics simulations by Euler equations. This module expands the [Euler2D](https://github.com/STCE-at-RWTH/Euler2D.jl) solver of Alexander Fleming developed at the [STCE group](stce.rwth-aachen.de) of RWTH Aachen University.

This project is developed as part of the Computational Engineering Science study at RWTH Aachen in 2024.

It is fit for 1D and 2D. 

It detects shock points, shock waves, and the normal direction of the shock points.
